                        <p>My passion for programming started when I was in High School, I was browsing through my YouTube recommendation when I was suddenly presented with a video on a behind-the-scene workings of a game that was in development by an Indie Game-dev/YouTuber.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="about-info">
                        <p>I was fascinated as to how the inner workings of programming and the uses of logic and problem solving was used and how the product would come to be in the end, and as I delve deeper on what it means to code, I discovered various other aspects that shifted my focus to just Gaming to Software Development as a whole.</p>

                    <div class="about-info">
                        <p>At that point I knew what I wanted to do and set out to watch various tutorials on different practices, coding languages, etc. It was a very tedious yet fun past time for me and I knew I wanted this to be a career someday so I set my sights on going to College to be a fully fledge Software Developer.</p>
